# Changelog

## 2026-08-02 - Active documentation consolidation

- Reduced the active documentation surface to current contracts, current state, recent continuation history, and operational instructions.
- Removed completed migration studies, duplicate Gemini strategy material, completed calendar/finance plans, old changelog entries, and the SaaS task-by-task closure ledger from the working tree; Git history preserves them.
- Replaced repeated research and prompt libraries with concise React, App API, clinical-finance, and product workflow contracts.
- Simplified README, project/module state, operations, and documentation navigation so each fact has one active owner.
- Binding API, tenant, entitlement, and decision contracts retain their necessary detail.

## 2026-08-01 - Appointment checkout completion contract

- Completed Product Workflow Roadmap Phase 3C at the existing appointment transition boundary; no competing checkout route or write workflow was added.
- Clean consultation-only visits can complete normally when no clinical or financial follow-up is present.
- Completion now reports unresolved clinical work, uninvoiced charges, mixed-currency charges, outstanding balances, and contextual legacy links before the visit can close.
- Users with the existing `appointments:edit` permission may intentionally complete with open items only after an explicit acknowledgement and a 10-500 character reason.
- Completion exceptions are written to the appointment activity trail with the issue codes and operator reason.
- Direct `in_chair -> completed` and normal `checkout -> completed` transitions use the same server-owned assessment, preventing the compatibility path from bypassing checkout review.
- Existing Examination, Treatment, Finance, payment, and appointment-stage services remain authoritative. Nothing is auto-completed, auto-invoiced, or auto-paid.
- Added `AppointmentCheckoutCompletionServiceTest`: 6 tests and 11 assertions covering clean completion, issue classification, mixed currencies, acknowledgement, and reason validation.
- Deferred manual QA: verify clean and exception completion in English/Arabic, AJAX and normal POST behavior, view-only permissions, activity evidence, and all five checkout states on local/deployed authenticated sessions.

## 2026-08-01 - Explicit appointment-to-clinical linkage

- Completed Product Workflow Roadmap Phase 3B for newly created appointment-context clinical work.
- Added a nullable, indexed `examinations.appointment_id` so an Examination started from Appointment detail retains durable visit identity after redirects and later handoffs.
- Shared Examination and Treatment full-page/modal forms now carry the same appointment context; no duplicate create surface was added.
- Added a fail-closed appointment context service that accepts only an appointment in the active clinic belonging to the selected patient.
- New Treatments started in appointment context propagate the validated appointment to both the canonical clinical procedure and optional clinical charge line.
- Appointment checkout now prefers explicit examination/procedure links while retaining clearly labeled patient/date matching for legacy records.
- Existing Treatments and examinations were not backfilled because their historical appointment intent is ambiguous.
- Added `ClinicalAppointmentContextServiceTest` and expanded checkout/procedure integration coverage. Focused verification passes with 17 tests and 124 assertions.
- Deployment requires `php spark migrate`; the canonical Hostinger SQL dump was regenerated.
- Deferred manual QA: create an Examination from Appointment detail, continue into Treatment with and without charge capture, return to the Appointment, and confirm checkout shows explicit linkage in English and Arabic.
- No automatic billing, clinical completion, appointment transition, or legacy inference was introduced.

Older implementation history is available through Git. Current state is summarized in PROJECT_STATE.md and module state documents.
