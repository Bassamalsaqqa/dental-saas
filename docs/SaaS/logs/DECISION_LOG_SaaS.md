# SaaS Decision Log (Append-Only)

## 2026-01-13 — Establish SaaS Source of Truth
- Decision: Created `SAAS_PROGRAM.md` as the canonical SaaS governance doc under `docs/SaaS/`. All SaaS tasks must reference it.
- Rationale: Centralize non-negotiables, contracts, phases, and guardrails for the multi-tenant track; avoid divergence from supporting plans.
- Impact: Future SaaS work must add Task IDs and verification under `docs/SaaS/`, and log decisions/implementation in this folder only.
