### Task: P5-19 Control Plane Entry + Missing Surfaces (Routes/UX Alignment)
- **Date:** 2026-01-16
- **Status:** Completed
- **Description:** Implemented missing Control Plane surfaces and aligned navigation UX.
- **Actions:**
    - **Routes:** Verified `GET /controlplane` and added `operations`, `settings` routes under `controlplane` group.
    - **Controllers:** Created `ControlPlane\Operations` and `ControlPlane\Settings` (thin wrappers).
    - **Views:** Created `control_plane/operations.php` (links only) and `control_plane/settings.php` (policy note).
    - **Layout:** Aligned `layouts/control_plane.php` navigation links to actual routes.
- **Verification:** `docs/SaaS/verification/P5-19.md` confirms route completeness and security behavior.
- **Guardrails:** Green.
