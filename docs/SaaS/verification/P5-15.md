# P5-15 Verification Report: Control Plane Operator Console

## 1. Summary
Replaced the system dashboard with an authoritative Operator Console. The console provides real-time visibility into governance state, security audits, and notification posture using a strictly plain and functional interface.

## 2. Component Verification

### A. Routes Evidence
Command: `php spark routes | findstr /I "controlplane dashboard settings plans onboarding"`
```text
| GET    | controlplane/dashboard                    | \App\Controllers\ControlPlane\Dashboard::index                | controlplane |
| GET    | controlplane/operations                   | \App\Controllers\ControlPlane\Operations::index               | controlplane |
| GET    | controlplane/settings                     | \App\Controllers\ControlPlane\Settings::index                 | controlplane |
| GET    | controlplane/onboarding/clinic/create     | \App\Controllers\ControlPlane\Onboarding::createClinic        | controlplane |
| GET    | controlplane/plans                        | \App\Controllers\ControlPlane\PlanManagement::index           | controlplane |
```

### B. SQL Evidence (Authoritative State)
Captured verbatim from system models:

**Plan Inventory:**
```text
Array([0] => Array([status] => active, [c] => 18), [1] => Array([status] => inactive, [c] => 4))
```

**Clinic & Subscription Stats:**
- Clinics Total: 5
- Active Subscriptions: 4

**Recent Security Audits (plan_audits):**
```text
[0] => Array([action_key] => clinic_onboard, [reason_code] => MANUAL_ONBOARDING, [created_at] => 2026-01-16 08:42:04, [clinic_id] => 5)
[1] => Array([action_key] => clinic_onboard, [reason_code] => MANUAL_ONBOARDING, [created_at] => 2026-01-16 07:03:12, [clinic_id] => 4)
```

**Notification Posture (Registry):**
```text
[0] => Array([channel_type] => email, [enabled_by_superadmin] => 1, [validated] => 1, [c] => 1)
```

## 3. UI/UX Constraint Compliance
- **Visuals:** Plain tables, monospace tabular data, no charts, no grids, no colored cards.
- **Hierarchy:** Ordered as Observability > Governance > Notifications > Operations > Destructive Actions.
- **Links:** All operations are presented as secondary plain text links.
- **Separation:** Destructive actions are isolated in a high-contrast rose-bordered "DANGER ZONE".

## 4. Guardrails Check
Command: `bash scripts/ci/saas_guardrails.sh`
Result: Passed.
- DOM Sinks: 0
- Auth Bypasses: 0
- Raw Tenant Queries: 8 (Baseline maintained)
