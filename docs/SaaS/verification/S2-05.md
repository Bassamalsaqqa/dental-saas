# Verification: S2-05 Clinic switch UX

## Objective
Allow users to switch clinics easily from the UI.

## 1. Controller Logic
**Method:** `ClinicSelector::switchClinic`
- Accepts `clinic_id`.
- Validates membership.
- Clears old keys.
- Regenerates session.
- Sets new keys.
- Redirects to `/dashboard`.

## 2. UI Integration
- Added "Switch Clinic" link to User Menu in `app/Views/layouts/main_auth.php`.
- Points to `/clinic/select` (which handles auto-redirect if only 1, or list if >1).
- This approach avoids querying the DB on every page load to list clinics in the dropdown, adhering to performance constraints.

## 3. Security
- Switching validates membership explicitly.
- Session regeneration prevents fixation.
