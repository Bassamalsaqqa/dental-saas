# Verification: S3-05 Allowlist Hygiene

## Objective
Shrink allowlist if possible.

## 1. Status
**Allowlist File:** `docs/SaaS/guardrails/raw-tenant-queries.allowlist`
**Changes:** None.
**Reason:**
- Phase 3 focused on Schema and Write-Path.
- Read-Path (SELECT) queries in controllers are still raw and unscoped.
- These will be refactored in **Phase 4: TenantBaseModel & Query Refactor**, at which point the allowlist entries will be removed.
