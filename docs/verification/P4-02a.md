# Verification P4-02a: Branding (Logo Render + Tagline)

## File List Touched
- `app/Controllers/Settings.php`
- `app/Services/SettingsService.php`
- `app/Views/settings/index.php`
- `app/Views/layouts/main_auth.php`
- `app/Views/layouts/main.php`
- `docs/verification/P4-02a.md`
- `docs/SECURITY_HARDENING_PROGRAM.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`
- `docs/DECISION_LOG.md`
- `docs/USER_GUIDE_BRANDING.md`

## Keys Added
- `clinic_logo_path`
- `clinic_tagline`

## Implementation Details
- `Settings.php` controller handles validation and persistence of new keys.
- `SettingsService.php` provides global access to `logo_path` and `tagline` via `getClinicInfo()`.
- Layouts (`main_auth.php`, `main.php`) use conditional rendering for logo (IMG if path set, else ICON) and dynamic tagline.
- Literal "Professional Suite" removed from layouts; now sourced from settings default.
